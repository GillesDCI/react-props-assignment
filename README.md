# Task : Create React components with props

In this task we are going to build a small application that shows a list of users in nicely designed cards. 

## Task 1 - Creat react app 

1. Create a new folder called my `props-assignment-react`
 
2. Open the folder in visual studio and execute the following command in the terminal: 
   `npx create-react-app .  `
3. Ready to go! :) 



## Task 2 - Create a component that shows list of users
1. Create new folder `components` inside the `src` folder. 
2. Create a new folder called  `UserCard`.
3. Create a new file `index.js` inse the `UserCard` folder. 
4. Write out the component. You can use the following snippet as a help: 
 ```javascript
const UserCard = () => {
    return (
    
    );
}
export default UserCard;
   ```
You can use a style library like bootstrap or you can also apply your own styles. 
5. Make sure the component uses a prop called `user`
